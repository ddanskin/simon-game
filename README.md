# Project Title
[Simon](https://ddanskin.github.io/simon-game/)

# Motivation
To build an animated replica of [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)), the electronic memory game. Originally completed as part of Free Code Camp Front End Development Certification coursework.

# Built with
* howler.js
* Google Fonts

# Features
The player can choose between playing in regular mode where they are given repeated chances to guess the pattern, or strict mode, where the game will end if a wrong color is chosen. As the player progresses through the game, the patterns will play more quickly. When buttons are clicked they flash and play their own sound. The game also flashes a pattern of lights with sounds when the player selects the wrong color and when the game is over.
